# Deploying an EVM Contract on a Polkadot EVM Parachain (Use case A RealEstate dApp)

## Overview
Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial! You’ll learn how to deploy a simple RealEstate smart contract on a Polkadot EVM-compatible parachain (like Moonbase Alpha, a testnet for Moonbeam). We’ll use tools you might already know from Ethereum—like MetaMask and Hardhat—to make it feel familiar. By the end, you’ll have a working decentralized app (dApp) and understand how Polkadot’s ecosystem can power Ethereum-style contracts.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Yarn (v1 or later)
- npm (latest vision)
- Setup your Metamask wallet and add moonbaseAlpha testnet
